- Unarmed attacks deal 1d8 additional force damage  
- Unarmed attacks have a chance to make you Drunk for 5 turns  
### Where can I find these items?  
Whiskeymancy is a forbidden art, shunned by good and evil aligned adventures alike due to the inherit danger and destructivity of whiskey based magic. There are only two locations where they can be found:  
  
1. Last Light Inn - Quartermaster Talli  
Word has it that the people taking refuge at the Last Light Inn have found Whiskeymancy to be a steadfast and reliable bulwark against the creatures found within the Shadow-cursed Lands  
2.Sorcerous Sundries - Shopkeep  
Gale: Really? You'r expecting a description? IT'S SORCEROUS SUNDRIES FOR CRYING OUT LOUD! It's the premier source of magic artifacts, you won't find a more likely place to find information pertaining to 'forbidden' arts than here.
