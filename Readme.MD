## Where can I find these items?  
Whiskeymancy is a forbidden art, shunned by good and evil aligned adventures alike due to the inherit danger and destructivity of whiskey based magic. Currently these items can be found with Arron in the Emerald Grove, but this is not the intended location since the Whiskeymancer's ring is rather OP when used correctly, so I really want this stuff to be available later on. That said, the full set runs about ~3.6k Gold so good luck getting it super early in the game  
## Installation  
It's recommended to use [BG3 Mod Manager](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager), you can find the latest release [HERE](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager/releases).  
1. Open BG3ModManager, and drag-and-drop the Zip file onto the window  
2. The mod should appear as "Whiskeymancy" in the 'Inactive Mods' list, right-click and select 'Allow in Load Order'  
3. In the top menu-bar, click:  
1. File ➡ Save Order (Ctrl+S)  
2. File ➡ Export Order to Game (Ctrl+E)  
  
I don't recommended installing it manually, I wouldn't try to do that and I'm the one that made this mod!
